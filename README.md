# SpaceTraders Tests

Shareable tests for spacetraders.io

Writing a space traders client is non-trivial. It can help to have a set of
tests to validate your client. This project is a set of tests that can be used
to validate your client.

## Contributions welcome

The idea is just to have a place where clients of various languages can share
tests.  It doesn't even have to be this repo, just needed a place to start.

Currently there are only pathing tests, since that seems one of the hardest
parts of the game to write without comparison points.
